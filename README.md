Developed a CNN model for heart disease classification(Global Hypokineasia)
Methadology
The methodology focuses on classifying MRI images using CNNs, with a key emphasis on data augmentation to enhance model robustness.
The dataset, sourced from Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, comprised 30 individuals with good health and 30 with Global Hypokinesia, each contributing 25 selected heart images. The dataset was expanded eightfold through rotation and flipping, resulting in 480 images. This augmented dataset aids in reducing overfitting and improving training effectiveness. 
Training and testing were conducted using a 7:3 split, further divided into test and validation subsets in a 7:3 ratio.
The model underwent iterative training using a k-fold cross-validation approach for 10 iterations, ensuring comprehensive training and reliable performance evaluation. 
K-fold cross-validation mitigates overfitting, provides robust performance estimates, and enhances confidence in model generalizability.
